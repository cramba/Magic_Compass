<p>As part of the MCI project, a compass was implemented based on the model from Pirates of the Caribbean.

Unlike a conventional compass, this one does not point north, but to the destination of your greatest desire.

This was realized by a close interaction between hardware and software. 

All the necessary components are housed in a beautiful brass case.

The compass is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. This receives its current location from a GPS module. In addition, a compass sensor detects the current orientation of the device. With the help of this information, the compass can calculate in which direction the needle must be moved in order to point to the desired target. The compass needle can be moved very precisely with the help of a stepper motor. 
In addition, there is an LED ring display that shows the distance traveled to the target as progress. the closer you get to the target, the more the ring closes. If you move away from the target, this is displayed with red lights.

The desired target coordinates can be transferred to the compass via NFC.</p>
